Notes - 
Supports both linear and nonlinear regression, tries to combine linear regression and polynomial regression as much as possible while maintaining elements of both
SVR performs regression in a higher dimensional space
Each data point is a dimension, get a vector from evaluating the training point from all the dimensions
Use the vector to perform the linear regression
Epsilon is the parameter that allows the spread of the streets

REQUIRMENTS
Need training set which covers the SVR
