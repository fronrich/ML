CART
Classification and Regression Trees -  2 types of trees
Regression trees are more complex
Given x1 and x2 on the scatter plot predict y which in this case is the third dimension
Essentially create a new dimension of variables
After running the regression tree, the scatter plot will be split into segments
Split on the x axis greater and less than y axis as well 
These splits are determineed by the algorithm- looks at the information entropy
Does the split increase the info about the points, looks for value added
Algorithm knows that if we aren't adding a certain amount each split, it knows it is done splitting
Essentially finds the final splits into terminal leaves
From each split we have 2 choices, split the points less than 20 and then split based on each decision split
Called a decision 3 because of this tree of choices

HOW TO PREDICT Y
Given x1 and x2 we fall into a certain segment of the plot
Take the average of the terminal leaf that the point falls in
That is the average for y for that terminal leaf
Remember that the y is in the third dimension
By taking averages of sections of scatter plots that makes the resultant number more accurate
