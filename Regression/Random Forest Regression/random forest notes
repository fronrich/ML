Random Forest Regression
-Version of Ensemble learning
-Ensemble learning is when you put together multiple algos together
Steps
Step 1: Pick at random k data points from the training set
Step 2: Build  a decision tree associated to these k data points
Step 3: Choose the number of Ntree of trees you want to build and repeat steps 1 and 2
Step 4: For a new data point make each one of your trees predict the value of y for the data points and assign
the new data point the average across all the predicted y values from each trees

We don't have to worry about the risk that is associated with one tree being built badly
 because of an anomaly

 Jar of marbles example with writing numbers down and then average the numbers together
 or take the median to get rid of outliers
 Doing this has a better chance at winning the contest
 By averaging out the guesses you are able to get in the money, it is an example
 of an Ensemble algorithm
